#+TITLE: Currently Unnamed Roblox One Piece Game 

- Working Title: Conqueror's Journey

* Goals
** Overarching
   - Like /DeepWoken/
     - Roguelike, but involving skill (at least in PvP)
       - I.e, a lvl1 player /could/ beat a lvl100 player
     - Treasure System 
       - Each zone will have random events, but based on the theme of the zone
       - Each zone/enemy drops from a pool of items
	 - Loot based on Beli and gems (not crazy weapons)
	 - Devil Fruit drop rate = **low**

** Char Creation
   - Customization 
     - Looks (very)
     - Stats
       - Speed and Movement (agility)
	 - Stamina?
       - Attack power and carrying capacity (strength)
       - Defense (fortitude) - armament haki
       - Observation(?) - observation haki
     - Conqueror's Haki
       - Born with it (low, gacha-type chances)
       - Difficult (endgame) questline to get it for the next character you roll

** Combat
   - Haki
     - Able to train it
     - Observation and Armament + their extensions (future sight and reiou)
   - Basic Combat
     - Real-time type (you throw a punch, everyone in the range gets hit)
     - Parry system
       - As you block attacks, a bar fills; once full, your block breaks and you're stunned
       - However, by tapping block, it'll decrease the bar and parry

** General
   - Stamina
     - Jumping
   - Cooldowns for powerful abilities
     - Mana (name in progress) bar for abilities

** Pie-In-The-Sky
   - Consistent world
   - If you have a Devil Fruit, you are the only one with that DF until you
     die
   - Consistent ranks (4 Kings, etc)
   - Future Sight
   - Crew system (player guilds)

** Gameplay Loop
   - Exploration and Combat

* Implementation
** Roguelike
   - 3 lives, if you burn them all, you reroll

** Skill
   - Power normalization in PvP zones(?)
